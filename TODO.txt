LESSON 1
1. In the "SEM TURPIS AMET SEMPER" section add three new cards just like the old ones. I want the title of the first card to say "CARD ONE", the second to say "CARD TWO", and the third to say "CARD THREE". Please find new icons to use for each as well, you can pick the icons.
2. I don't like the background image of the main hero banner (the area that says "INDUSTRIOUS"). Can you please change that to be a skyline or something a bit more colorful?
3. I want an alert to pop up whenever any of the cards get clicked. The pop up should say "welcome!"`
4. button near the footer that shows a list of 5, written to the html. Have the button be white but turn red when clicked
5. Create a simple contact us section: so a header that says contact us, an email input field, and a name input field. When a user types it in and hits submit, donâ€™t worry about sending it anywhere just console.log the values
